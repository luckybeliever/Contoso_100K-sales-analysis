## Overview  
This project uses four CSV files and four Power BI dashboards built on Contoso’s sales data. It examines order details, discount patterns, customer behavior, and store performance to understand what drives net revenue and suggest ways to improve profitability.

## Business Problem  
Although Contoso’s total order count grew steadily from 2015 through 2024, net revenue (sales minus discounts) flattened after 2022 and then declined. This project investigates how discount levels, the mix of new vs. returning customers, customer shopping habits, and store performance affect net revenue.

## Assumptions  
1. The Contoso dataset includes every order, discount record, customer type flag, and store sale from 2015–2024.  
2. “New” vs. “Returning” customer labels remain consistent throughout the period.  
3. Discount values in the data accurately reflect Contoso’s promotions.  
4. Seasonal events, holidays, and macroeconomic shifts are outside the study’s scope.  
5. There are no major data errors (duplicates or missing entries) that would skew results.

## Research Questions  
1. **Revenue & Cohorts**  
   - How has net revenue changed year by year?  
   - What share of net revenue comes from new versus returning customers?  

2. **Brand & Discount Effects**  
   - How much of Contoso’s revenue is given back as discounts, and what remains?  
   - Which product brands receive the most discount spend, and which generate the most net revenue?  
   - What relationship exists between average discount percentage and net revenue over time?

3. **Customer Habits & Timing**  
   - In a selected product category and customer group, how do discounts compare to net revenue?  
   - Which weekdays see the highest order volumes?  
   - What product colors are customers choosing most often?

4. **Store & Product Variant Analysis**  
   - How do quarterly discount totals and net revenue evolve over time?  
   - Which store locations contribute the most sales?  
   - Which product variants appear most frequently in orders?

## Hypotheses  
1. Higher discount rates boost order volume but reduce profit per sale.  
2. Returning customers contribute more net revenue per order because they require smaller discounts.  
3. Orders peak from Wednesday through Saturday, suggesting optimal promotion windows.  
4. A small number of flagship stores generate the majority of sales, while smaller locations lag.

## Insights  
- **Net Revenue Trend**  
  Rose from \$10 M in 2015 to \$45 M in 2022, then fell to \$20 M by 2024.  

- **Cohort Contribution**  
  New customers account for 66 % (\$136 M) of net revenue; returning customers account for 34 % (\$70 M).  

- **Brand-Level Discounts**  
  Contoso issued \$10.9 M in total discounts: Brand A (31.6 %), Brand B (24.0 %), Brand C (19.5 %). Adventure Works leads with \$47 M net revenue.  

- **Customer Habits & Timing**  
  In the Audio category for male buyers, \$164 K in discounts produced \$2.65 M net. Saturday is the busiest day (~1,700 orders). Five color groups make up 96 % of purchases.  

- **Quarterly & Store Performance**  
  Quarterly discounts rose from \$0.1 M (Q1 2015) to \$0.5 M (Q3 2019); net revenue climbed from \$1.5 M to \$10 M. Contoso Store Freie Hansestadt is the top location.  

- **Product Variant Counts**  
  Top product variants appear between 2,100 and 3,400 times in orders.

## Suggestions  
1. **Limit Discount Levels**  
   Keep standard discounts near 10 % and reserve deeper cuts for targeted flash deals.  

2. **Encourage Repeat Business**  
   Offer loyalty perks to returning customers, who provide higher net revenue per order.  

3. **Optimize Brand Promotions**  
   For brands with high discount spend but lower net returns, use tiered or bundled offers.  

4. **Time Promotions Strategically**  
   Run main promotions Wednesday through Saturday; add a brief Tuesday flash sale to boost slower days.  

5. **Bundle Popular & Slow-Moving Items**  
   Pair best-selling variants or colors with slower ones in value bundles to clear inventory.  

6. **Focus on Top Stores**  
   Allocate marketing efforts to high-performing flagship locations and test pop-up events in smaller markets.  

7. **Track New-Customer Retention**  
   Measure how many new customers return without extra discounts to assess loyalty program success.

6. **Focus Marketing on Top Stores**  
   Move resources from low-volume stores to high-performing flagship locations and consider pop-up events in smaller markets.

7. **Track New-Customer Loyalty**  
   Measure how many new customers return without extra discounts to gauge long-term loyalty.
