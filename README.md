# Sales Analysis of Contoso_100K dataset

Over the last ten years (2015‚Äì2024), our company has sold more and more products every year. But at the same time, we‚Äôve been giving bigger and bigger discounts. We worry that these discounts and a changing mix of new versus returning customers might be cutting into our profits.

So our main question is: **What parts of our sales process (customer types, brand discounts, buying habits, store performance) are helping revenue grow, and which parts are hurting it?** From there, we can choose better pricing and promotional tactics to increase our net revenue (the money we keep after discounts).

## Assumptions

1. **Complete Data**: Our four CSV files and Power BI dashboards include every order, discount, customer flag (new vs. returning), and store sale from 2015 through 2024.  
2. **Consistent Flags**: The way we mark someone as a ‚Äúnew‚Äù or ‚Äúexisting‚Äù customer hasn‚Äôt changed over time.  
3. **Accurate Discounts**: Discount amounts in the data really match the coupons or price cuts we offered.  
4. **Outside Factors Ignored**: Things like holidays, special events, or big economic changes aren‚Äôt part of this analysis‚Äîwe‚Äôre focused purely on prices, discounts, and customer behavior.  
5. **No Major Errors**: There are no big mistakes in the data (like duplicated orders) that would make our charts misleading.

## Research Questions

1. **Cohort & Geography**  
   - How did total net revenue (sales minus discounts) change each year?  
   - How much did new customers contribute versus returning customers?  
   - Which countries bought the most from us?

2. **Brand & Discount Impact**  
   - In total, how much revenue did we have before discounts (‚Äúbase revenue‚Äù) and how much discount did we give?  
   - Which brands received the largest share of our discount budget?  
   - After discounts, which brands still made the most money?  
   - Over time, did average discount percentages go up or down, and how did that affect net revenue?

3. **Customer Demographics & Timing**  
   - Looking at a single product category (e.g. Audio) and one gender (e.g. Male), how did discounts relate to the money we actually kept?  
   - Which day of the week has the most orders?  
   - What colors of product did customers choose most often?

4. **Store & Quarterly Trends**  
   - From quarter to quarter, how did our discount totals and net revenue move?  
   - Which physical stores (by region or city) sold the most?  
   - Which product descriptions (SKUs) appear most frequently in orders?

## Hypotheses

1. **New vs. Returning**  
   - New customers bring in more sales volume because we discount heavily to win them, but returning customers are more profitable since they don‚Äôt need as big a discount.  
2. **Discounts Drive Volume but Hurt Margins**  
   - If we cut prices by a higher percentage, we‚Äôll see more orders, but the extra volume won‚Äôt fully make up for the smaller margin per sale.  
3. **Weekend & Demographic Patterns**  
   - People shop most on Saturday, and maybe men and women shop differently (e.g., picking different colors).  
4. **Store Performance**  
   - The oldest or flagship stores do most of the business, while smaller or newer locations lag behind.

## Suggestions

1. **Shift Spending to Retention**  
   Reward returning customers with loyalty perks‚Äîthey buy without big discounts.

2. **Target Brand Discounts**  
   For brands that burn through discount dollars without top-line gains, use limited-time or tiered offers instead of flat cuts.

3. **Cap & Focus Discounts**  
   Keep standard discounts around 10 %, then run small flash sales on high-margin items.

4. **Use Peak Shopping Days**  
   Schedule promotions Wed‚ÄìSat, and try a ‚ÄúTuesday Flash Sale‚Äù for slower days.

5. **Bundle Best & Slow Movers**  
   Pair top colors or SKUs with slower-moving ones in bundles to clear inventory.

6. **Optimize Store Footprint**  
   Move marketing from under-utilized stores to flagship locations; explore pop-ups in smaller regions.

7. **Monitor Cohort Conversion**  
   Track how many new customers come back without extra discounts to measure real loyalty.
