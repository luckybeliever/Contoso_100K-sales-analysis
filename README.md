# Sales Report

## Overview  
This project looks at our company’s sales and discount data from 2015 to 2024. It uses four CSV files and four Power BI dashboards to show how orders, discounts, customer habits, and store results work together. The goal is to find what drives our net revenue and suggest ways to improve pricing, promotions, and customer loyalty.

## Business Problem  
Order volume has grown steadily over the last decade, yet net revenue (sales minus discounts) has stopped rising and even dropped since 2022. Heavy discounting, focusing too much on new customers, and uneven store performance have held us back. We need clear priorities for cutting unneeded discounts and boosting profit from every order.

## Assumptions  
1. All orders, discounts, customer types, and store sales from 2015–2024 are in these datasets.  
2. Labels for “new” versus “returning” customers stayed the same throughout.  
3. Discount figures in the data match real promotions exactly.  
4. Seasonal events and broad economic changes did not affect these numbers.  
5. No duplicate or missing records skew the conclusions.

## Research Questions  
1. **Cohort & Revenue Trends**  
   - What is the year-by-year pattern in net revenue?  
   - How much net revenue comes from new versus returning customers?  

2. **Brand & Discount Effects**  
   - What portion of revenue becomes discount, and what remains as net income?  
   - Which brands use the most discounts, and which earn the most after discounts?  
   - How does the discount percentage trend alongside net revenue?

3. **Customer Habits & Timing**  
   - In a chosen product category and customer group, how many discounts occur versus net revenue?  
   - Which weekdays have the highest order counts?  
   - Which product colors sell the most?

4. **Store & Variant Analysis**  
   - What happens to discounts and net revenue each quarter?  
   - Which store locations lead in sales?  
   - Which product variants appear in the most orders?

## Hypotheses  
1. High discount rates bring more orders but reduce the overall profit per order.  
2. Returning customers spend more net dollars per order because they need smaller discounts.  
3. Order counts peak from Wednesday through Saturday, creating prime promotion days.  
4. A few large stores handle most sales, while smaller locations lag behind.

## Insights  
- **Net Revenue Trend**  
  Net revenue rose from \$10 M in 2015 to \$45 M in 2022, then fell to \$20 M by 2024.  

- **Cohort Contribution**  
  New customers make up 66 % (\$136 M) of net revenue, and returning customers make up 34 % (\$70 M).  

- **Brand-Level Discounts**  
  We applied \$10.9 M in discounts. Brand A took 31.6 %, Brand B 24.0 %, Brand C 19.5 %. Adventure Works leads with \$47 M net revenue.  

- **Customer Habits & Timing**  
  In the Audio category for male buyers, \$164 K in discounts led to \$2.65 M net revenue. Saturday is the top day with about 1,700 orders. Five color groups make up 96 % of purchases.  

- **Quarterly & Store Performance**  
  Quarterly discounts rose from \$0.1 M in early 2015 to \$0.5 M by 2019. Quarterly net revenue grew from \$1.5 M to \$10 M. Contoso Store Freie Hansestadt leads all locations.  

- **Product Variant Counts**  
  Our top product variants appear between 2,100 and 3,400 times in orders.

## Suggestions  
1. **Limit Discount Levels**  
   Standard discounts stay near 10 %. Special flash deals boost high-margin items.

2. **Reward Returning Customers**  
   Loyalty perks encourage repeat business without large discounts.

3. **Target Brand Promotions**  
   Brands with high discount use and low net return get tiered or bundled offers for better results.

4. **Use Peak Days Wisely**  
   Main promotions run Wednesday through Saturday. A short Tuesday deal raises slower-day sales.

5. **Bundle Popular & Slow-Moving Items**  
   Pair top variants or colors with slower ones in value bundles to clear stock effectively.

6. **Focus Marketing on Top Stores**  
   Move resources from low-volume stores to high-performing flagship locations and consider pop-up events in smaller markets.

7. **Track New-Customer Loyalty**  
   Measure how many new customers return without extra discounts to gauge long-term loyalty.
